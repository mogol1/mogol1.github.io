            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>Hi! Thanks for visiting my website. My name is Ryan Mogol. I'm a student at <a href="http://www.umbc.edu" target="_blank"> UMBC</a>, currently pursuing a major in the Health Administration and Policy Program &#40;Administration Track&#41; and a minor in Information Systems. I also work at the Technology Support Center at UMBC. I do public relations for the Sikh Student Association at UMBC too. I don't really know what I'm going to do with this website yet. But hopefully it'll be good.</p>
            
            <h2>My Education:</h2>
            <p>I went to the <a href="http://www.parkschool.net/" target="_blank">Park School of Baltimore</a> for high school. Now I go to <a href="http://www.umbc.edu" target="_blank">UMBC</a> for the Health Administration and Policy Program. I'm also going after a minor in Information Systems. Hopefully I'll graduate in Spring 2019. That's the plan anyway.</p>
            
            <h2>My Skills:</h2>
            <p>I'm proficent in Microsoft Office and Google's G Suite, I can use a Mac or a PC, and my typing speed is somewhere between 60-70 WPM. I also designed and built this website myself. So I guess I'm alright at HTML and CSS too. Fun fact: I can type the alphabet in 1.9 seconds.</p>
            
            <h2>My Work Experience:</h2>
            <p> I did my Senior Project for high school at <a href="http://www.jemicyschool.org" target="_blank">Jemicy School</a>. It's a school for kids with dyslexia and other language-based learning differences. Here's what I did while I was there:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I taught fifth grade kids how to use Google Drive, Google Docs, and Google Slides so they could make written and visual reports.</li>
                <li>I reviewed the kids' written work and gave them feedback. I also made suggestions to them on how they can improve their writing.</li>
                <li>I also taught them how to use iMovie for the iPad to record videos as part of their projects.</li>
                <li>I tracked where the kids were in their projects, so I could provide suggestions to instructors.</li>
                <li>Some of the kids wanted to learn how to make websites. So I taught them how to make websites during recess. I think they just didn't want to go outside.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Now I work part-time at the <a href="http://doit.umbc.edu/tsc/" target="_blank">Technology Support Center &#40;TSC&#41;</a> at UMBC. It's a pretty nice job. Here's some of the things I do there:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I provide in person and online tech support to members of the UMBC community.</li>
                <li>I answer the phone if it rings. Usually it's someone who needs help with a computer. So I help them.</li>
                <li>I record all my interactions with customers, in detail, using our ticketing system.</li>
                <li>I figure out what kinds of computer problems people are actually having. Sometimes that can be harder than actually fixing the problem.</li>
                <li>For the tougher problems, my coworkers and I collaborate and figure out what's causing the problem and how we can fix it. Sometimes my supervisors join in on the fun too.</li>
            </ul>
