            <h2>About me:</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Ryan Mogol. I'm a student at <a href="http://www.umbc.edu" target="_blank"> UMBC</a>, currently persuing a major in the Health Administration and Policy Program &#40;Administration Track&#41; and a minor in Information Systems. I also work at the Technology Support Center at UMBC. I don't really know what I'm going to do with this website yet. But hopefully it'll be good.</p>
